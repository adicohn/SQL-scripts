# SQL-scripts
This repository contains some of the scripts that I'm using as a SQL Server DBA.  Some of the scripts were written by me, but some of them were written by other pepole and I found them on the internet during the last few years.  

The repository has two purposes:
1) Have one place on the internet that contains the scripts so I'll be able to use them where ever I am
2) Share the scripts and let other people use it.
